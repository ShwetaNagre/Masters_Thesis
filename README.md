Hello Everyone!!
Sharing some quick insights into this repo. This is my Masters Thesis Project, titled "Investigating metabolic re-wiring in
the children cohort using the Genome-Scale Metabolic (GEM) models."

The cellular metabolism for the childrens cohort was studied using the metabolic modelling approaches like Genome-scale metabolic modelling (GEM) and Flux Balance Analysis. Personalized GEMs were created, compared, and grouped together based on the similarities. Data-driven patient grouping allows healthcare providers to analyse large amounts of patient data to identify patterns, use of predictive analytics, and anticipate potential health risks. This personalized approach improves patient outcomes by ensuring that treatments are more effective and targeted. It plays a vital role in population health management.

We have used transcriptomics data derived from 150 children living in different socio-economic environment in South Africa. Context specific genome-scale metabolic modelling (GEM) was done using the Fast Task-driven Integrative Network Inference for Tissues (ftINIT) algorithm. Further, flux balance analysis (FBA) with ATP hydrolysis as objective function was performed to study the alterations in metabolic reactions in each sample specific GEMs.

The Hierarchical and K-means clustering using the matrix representing presence or absence of metabolic reactions in each GEM identified existence of four clusters of children (After removing an outlier sample). The cluster specific analysis of FBA results identified reactions related inflammatory pathways like leukotriene metabolism and omega-3 fatty acid metabolism is completely absent in cluster 2. Whereas the inflammatory mediator like prostaglandins show very low activation. This indicated the low inflammation characteristic of the cluster 2 compared to others.

The low inflammatory characteristic of the cluster 2 suggests that the cluster samples have adequate immune system, making them less susceptible to many diseases.
In addition to this, different statistical analysis on the clinical parameters/demographics was done. To check which parameters were significant for which cluster.

Thank you for reading.
